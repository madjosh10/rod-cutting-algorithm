# rod-cutting-algorithm

### 1. Implement two versions of the pseudo algorithm of the Rod Cutting Problem in Java/C/C++/Python (programming language you are familiar with) and compare the efficiency of those in terms of the number of recursive calls made. Your implement should follow the pseudocode provided in the textbook/lecture and use a table below for a sample price with pi dollars of revenue for the length i. You can certainly define pi dollars of the revenue. DO NOT COPY SOMEBODY ELSEâ€™S CODE! This includes online resources.

### 2. To test your algorithm implementations:
- [x] A user will enter a number for n, the size of the rod.
- [x] For each of the two algorithms, determine the optimal revenue rn with the
corresponding optimal decompositions of the n and display the revenue and
decompositions.
- [x] For each of the two algorithms, count a total number of recursive calls made in
determining rn and display/compare them.
- [x] Repeat a-c at least 5 times and show the results.
